# RTOS_Scheduler

This project implements a real-time operating system (RTOS) scheduler in C. The scheduler supports both round-robin scheduling and priority-based scheduling for task management. Each task is assigned a stack and managed by a Task Control Block(TCB), allowing for context switching, task blocking, and an idle task when no other tasks are ready to run.
